/* 
 * Finding movies with similar categories still gives you too many options.
 *
 * Write a SQL query that lists all movies that share 2 categories with AMERICAN CIRCUS and 1 actor.
 *
 * HINT:
 * It's possible to complete this problem both with and without set operations,
 * but I find the version using set operations much more intuitive.
